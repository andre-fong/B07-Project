Name: Xing Yu (Joe) Zhou

What have you done since yesterday?
	- I have finished some of the Admin Login functions (discarded for new design).
	- I reviewed Firebase Authentication and the Java code required to implement it.
	- I reviewed git branching commands.
	- I pulled and tested the current (new) login and signup system.

What are you planning on doing today?
	- I plan on designing a simple UI for the customer homepage (a spinner for the list of venues)
	- I plan to design a simple UI for the sports page after a venue is selected (a spinner for the list of sports)

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- The design for User Login/Sign-up was suddenly changed so most of my previous work for Admin Login had to be discarded
	- I had some trouble with Firebase Authentication and git commands (resolved).
