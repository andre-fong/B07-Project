Name: Xing Yu (Joe) Zhou

What have you done since yesterday?
	- I created a UI for Venues page (Customer Home Page Prototype) and linked it to the customer login
	- I fully tested the link between the Venues page and the customer login page and committed and pushed my changes to the signup-login branch once I fixed the issues

What are you planning on doing today?
	- I plan to make a design for the Customer Homepage (google docs or by paper)
	- I plan to make the Sport Object and commit and push that to GitHub

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- The spinner and UI took some time to review
	- The application kept on crashing during user Authentication (resolved)
	- The Venues page opened regardless if the correct password was entered (resolved)
